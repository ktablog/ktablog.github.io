  💻🌱 I am a software developer and data engineer who is keen to do coding and solve the economic problems.  Obviously I want to be a teammate to build wonderful things because I am an only one child in my family and there is no geek who can do coding among my relatives and neighbours.  
  
  🥰💎 To be honest, I want to be employed in a company where I can be part of a prominent team, so that I can wire in coding.  
  
  🏭🌳 I have 13+ years of experience in factory automation industry where I did control system design, electrical design and installation, PLC programming, robotic programming, servo control systems and service and commissioning.  
  
  🚀💐🍂 After completing my postgraduate study, I was part of a full stack development team for about one and half year.  Then I resigned from my job to take care my mother during the pandemic following my daddy's passing in 2020, October. 
  
  👩‍🏫🏫 In 2021 I founded a small language center and taught English in my neighbourhood.
  
  🧑‍💻 In 2022, I took some online courses associated with IT and computer science mainly from Edx, Oracle University, Google, Future Learn, LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Learing Path, tableau e-learning, Forage, etc.
  
  🤗🗺️🧭 Currently, I am ready to join a full stack development team or data engineering team or both anywhere in the World.  Please kindly review my resume and appreciate for your consideration.  I can be reached out immediately through my email or whatsapp.
