# ktablog.github.io.  This is my portfolio website.  

  I am an MBA graduate who is keen to do coding and solve the economic problems.  Obviously I want to be a teammate to build wonderful things because I am an only one child in my family and there is no geek who can do coding among my relatives and neighbours.  
  
  To be honest, I want to be employed in a company where I be part of a prominent team, so that I can wired in.
